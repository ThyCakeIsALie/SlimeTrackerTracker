# SlimeTrackerTracker
A tracker webpage designed to give a visual aid to the status of SlimeVR parts and the time since the first launch.

This webpage counts the time since August 31st 2021 based on days.
The hours, seconds, and minutes are more for looks vs tracking time elapsed

THE CHART PAGE

ACCURACY OF INFORMATION:
-Be aware I am in need of a site like this, I can barely read and understand the updates
please help me ensure values are correct! Contact ThyCakeIsALie#8262 on Discord if you see
anything out of place or plain wrong. I will take all the help!

WEBSITE CODE:
-I am new to programming webpages like this, so be weary of poor mobile support and small
differences in browsers. Firefox so far runs a bit slow so be aware~
